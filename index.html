  <p> It's <b>2019!</b> we're always talking about plastic free living and reducing our waste... BUT we don't really have any clue as to how we can achieve this.
Although we like to think we're doing enough when we put things in the recyling bin, the truth is that it's simply not enough! 
Only a tiny percentage of what we put in the recycling is actually recycled. 
What we really need to do is <b>R E D U C E</b> our general plastic consumption!!!
This site provides sustainable, ethical, and <b>PLASTIC FREE</b> alternatives to some of our fav everyday buys.</p>
